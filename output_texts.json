    "Advantages   and   Disadvantages   of   AI \nTushar   B.   Kute, http://tusharkute.com \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nReduction   in   Human   Error One   of   the   biggest   advantages   of   Artificial  \t Intelligence   is   that   it   can   significantly   reduce  \t errors   and   increase   accuracy   and   precision. The   decisions   taken   by   AI   in   every   step   is  \t decided   by   information   previously   gathered  \t and   a   certain   set   of   algorithms. When   programmed   properly,   these   errors   can  \t be   reduced   to  null. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nZero   Risks Another   big   advantage   of   AI   is   that   humans   can  overcome   many   risks   by   letting   AI   robots   do  them   for   us. Whether   it  be   defusing   a   bomb,   going   to   space,  exploring   the   deepest parts   of   oceans,  machines  with   metal   bodies   are   resistant  in  nature   and   can   survive   unfriendly   atmospheres. Moreover,   they   can   provide   accurate   work   with  greater   responsibility   and   not   wear   out   easily. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \n24x7   Availability There   are   many   studies   that   show   humans   are  productive   only   about   3   to   4   hours   in   a   day. Humans   also   need   breaks   and   time   offs   to  balance   their   work   life   and   personal   life.   But   AI  can   work   endlessly   without   breaks. They   think   much   faster   than   humans   and   perform multiple   tasks   at   a   time   with   accurate   results. They   can   even   handle   tedious   repetitive   jobs  easily   with   the   help   of   AI   algorithms. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nDigital   Assistance Almost   all   the   big   organizations   these   days   use  digital   assistants   to   interact   with   their   customers  which   significantly   minimizes   the   need   for   human resources. You   can   chat   with   a   chatbot   and   ask   them   exactly  what   you   need. Some   chatbots   have   become   so   intelligent   these  days   that   you   wouldn’t   be   able   to   determine  whether   you   are   chatting   with   a   chatbot   or   a  human   being. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNew   Inventions AI   has   helped   in   coming   up   with   new  \t inventions   in   almost   every   domain   to   solve  \t complex   problems. A   recent   invention   has   helped   doctors   to  \t predict   early   stages   of   breast   cancer   in  \t women   using   advanced   AI- based \ttechnologies. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nUnbiased   Decisions Human   beings   are   driven   by   emotions,  \t whether   we   like   it   or   not. AI   on   the   other   hand,   is   devoid   of   emotions  \t and   highly   practical   and   rational   in   its  \t approach. A   huge   advantage   of   Artificial   Intelligence   is  \t that   it   doesn't   have   any   biased   views,   which \tensures   more   accurate   decision-making. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nHigh   Costs The   ability   to   create   a   machine   that   can  \t simulate   human   intelligence   is   no   small   feat. It   requires   plenty   of   time   and   resources   and  \t can   cost   a   huge   deal   of   money. AI   also   needs   to   operate   on   the   latest  \t hardware   and   software   to   stay   updated   and  \t meet   the   latest   requirements,   thus   making   it  \t quite   costly.",

    "Advantages   and   Disadvantages   of   AI \nTushar   B.   Kute, http://tusharkute.com \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nReduction   in   Human   Error One   of   the   biggest   advantages   of   Artificial  \t Intelligence   is   that   it   can   significantly   reduce  \t errors   and   increase   accuracy   and   precision. The   decisions   taken   by   AI   in   every   step   is  \t decided   by   information   previously   gathered  \t and   a   certain   set   of   algorithms. When   programmed   properly,   these   errors   can  \t be   reduced   to  null. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nZero   Risks Another   big   advantage   of   AI   is   that   humans   can  overcome   many   risks   by   letting   AI   robots   do  them   for   us. Whether   it  be   defusing   a   bomb,   going   to   space,  exploring   the   deepest parts   of   oceans,  machines  with   metal   bodies   are   resistant  in  nature   and   can   survive   unfriendly   atmospheres.

    "Advantages   and   Disadvantages   of   AI \nTushar   B.   Kute, http://tusharkute.com \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nReduction   in   Human   Error One   of   the   biggest   advantages   of   Artificial  \t Intelligence   is   that   it   can   significantly   reduce  \t errors   and   increase   accuracy   and   precision. The   decisions   taken   by   AI   in   every   step   is  \t decided   by   information   previously   gathered  \t and   a   certain   set   of   algorithms. When   programmed   properly,   these   errors   can  \t be   reduced   to  null. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nZero   Risks Another   big   advantage   of   AI   is   that   humans   can  overcome   many   risks   by   letting   AI   robots   do  them   for   us. Whether   it  be   defusing   a   bomb,   going   to   space,  exploring   the   deepest parts   of   oceans,  machines  with   metal   bodies   are   resistant  in  nature   and   can   survive   unfriendly   atmospheres. Moreover,   they   can   provide   accurate   work   with  greater   responsibility   and   not   wear   out   easily. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \n24x7   Availability There   are   many   studies   that   show   humans   are  productive   only   about   3   to   4   hours   in   a   day. Humans   also   need   breaks   and   time   offs   to  balance   their   work   life   and   personal   life.   But   AI  can   work   endlessly   without   breaks. They   think   much   faster   than   humans   and   perform multiple   tasks   at   a   time   with   accurate   results. They   can   even   handle   tedious   repetitive   jobs  easily   with   the   help   of   AI   algorithms. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nDigital   Assistance Almost   all   the   big   organizations   these   days   use  digital   assistants   to   interact   with   their   customers  which   significantly   minimizes   the   need   for   human resources. You   can   chat   with   a   chatbot   and   ask   them   exactly  what   you   need.

    "Advantages   and   Disadvantages   of   AI \nTushar   B.   Kute, http://tusharkute.com \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nReduction   in   Human   Error One   of   the   biggest   advantages   of   Artificial  \t Intelligence   is   that   it   can   significantly   reduce  \t errors   and   increase   accuracy   and   precision. The   decisions   taken   by   AI   in   every   step   is  \t decided   by   information   previously   gathered  \t and   a   certain   set   of   algorithms. When   programmed   properly,   these   errors   can  \t be   reduced   to  null. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nZero   Risks Another   big   advantage   of   AI   is   that   humans   can  overcome   many   risks   by   letting   AI   robots   do  them   for   us. Whether   it  be   defusing   a   bomb,   going   to   space,  exploring   the   deepest parts   of   oceans,  machines  with   metal   bodies   are   resistant  in  nature   and   can   survive   unfriendly   atmospheres. Moreover,   they   can   provide   accurate   work   with  greater   responsibility   and   not   wear   out   easily. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \n24x7   Availability There   are   many   studies   that   show   humans   are  productive   only   about   3   to   4   hours   in   a   day. Humans   also   need   breaks   and   time   offs   to  balance   their   work   life   and   personal   life.   But   AI  can   work   endlessly   without   breaks. They   think   much   faster   than   humans   and   perform multiple   tasks   at   a   time   with   accurate   results. They   can   even   handle   tedious   repetitive   jobs  easily   with   the   help   of   AI   algorithms. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nDigital   Assistance Almost   all   the   big   organizations   these   days   use  digital   assistants   to   interact   with   their   customers  which   significantly   minimizes   the   need   for   human resources. You   can   chat   with   a   chatbot   and   ask   them   exactly  what   you   need. Some   chatbots   have   become   so   intelligent   these  days   that   you   wouldn’t   be   able   to   determine  whether   you   are   chatting   with   a   chatbot   or   a  human   being. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNew   Inventions AI   has   helped   in   coming   up   with   new  \t inventions   in   almost   every   domain   to   solve  \t complex   problems. A   recent   invention   has   helped   doctors   to  \t predict   early   stages   of   breast   cancer   in  \t women   using   advanced   AI- based \ttechnologies. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nUnbiased   Decisions Human   beings   are   driven   by   emotions,  \t whether   we   like   it   or   not. AI   on   the   other   hand,   is   devoid   of   emotions  \t and   highly   practical   and   rational   in   its  \t approach. A   huge   advantage   of   Artificial   Intelligence   is  \t that   it   doesn't   have   any   biased   views,   which \tensures   more   accurate   decision-making. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nHigh   Costs The   ability   to   create   a   machine   that   can  \t simulate   human   intelligence   is   no   small   feat. It   requires   plenty   of   time   and   resources   and  \t can   cost   a   huge   deal   of   money. AI   also   needs   to   operate   on   the   latest  \t hardware   and   software   to   stay   updated   and  \t meet   the   latest   requirements,   thus   making   it  \t quite   costly. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNo   creativity A   big   disadvantage   of   AI   is   that   it   cannot   learn   to   think  outside   the   box. AI   is   capable   of   learning   over   time   with   pre- fed   data   and  past   experiences,   but   cannot   be   creative   in   its   approach. A   classic   example   is   the   bot   Quill   who   can   write   Forbes  earning   reports.   These   reports   only   contain   data   and  facts   already   provided   to   the   bot. Although   it   is   impressive   that   a   bot   can   write   an   article  on   its   own,   it   lacks   the   human   touch   present   in   other  Forbes   articles. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nIncrease   in   Unemployment Perhaps   one   of   the   biggest   disadvantages   of  \t artificial   intelligence   is   that   AI   is   slowly   replacing   a  \t number   of   repetitive   tasks   with   bots. The   reduction   in   the   need   for   human   interference  \t has   resulted   in   the   death   of   many   job   opportunities. A   simple   example   is   the   chatbot   which   is   a   big  \t advantage   to   organizations,   but   a   nightmare   for  \t employees. A   study   by   McKinsey   predicts   that   AI   will   replace   at  \t least   30   percent   of   human   labour   by   2030. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nMake   Humans   Lazy AI   applications   automate   the   majority   of  \t tedious   and   repetitive   tasks. Since   we   do   not   have   to   memorize   things   or  \t solve   puzzles   to   get   the   job   done,   we   tend   to  \t use   our   brains   less   and   less. This   addiction   to   AI   can  cause   problems   to  \t future   generations. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNo   Ethics Ethics   and   morality   are   important   human  \t features   that   can   be   difficult   to   incorporate  \t into   an   AI. The   rapid   progress   of   AI  has   raised   a   number  \t of   concerns   that   one   day,   AI   will   grow  \t uncontrollably,   and   eventually   wipe   out  \t humanity. This   moment   is   referred   to   as   the   AI  \t singularity. \nSummary \n• \nArtificial   intelligence   has   massive   potential   for  creating   a   better   world   to   live   in. The   most   important   role   for   humans   will   be   to  ensure   that   the   rise   of   the   AI   doesn’t   get   out   of  hand. Although   there   are   both   debatable   pros   and   cons  of   artificial   intelligence   ,   its   impact   on   the   global  industry   is   undeniable. It   continues   to   grow   every   single   day   driving  sustainability   for   businesses. \n• \n• \n•",

The   decisions   taken   by   AI   in   every   step   is  \t decided   by   information   previously   gathered  \t and   a   certain   set   of   algorithms. When   programmed   properly,   these   errors   can  \t be   reduced   to  null. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nZero   Risks Another   big   advantage   of   AI   is   that   humans   can  overcome   many   risks   by   letting   AI   robots   do  them   for   us. Whether   it  be   defusing   a   bomb,   going   to   space,  exploring   the   deepest parts   of   oceans,  machines  with   metal   bodies   are   resistant  in  nature   and   can   survive   unfriendly   atmospheres. Moreover,   they   can   provide   accurate   work   with  greater   responsibility   and   not   wear   out   easily. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \n24x7   Availability There   are   many   studies   that   show   humans   are  productive   only   about   3   to   4   hours   in   a   day. Humans   also   need   breaks   and   time   offs   to  balance   their   work   life   and   personal   life.   But   AI  can   work   endlessly   without   breaks. They   think   much   faster   than   humans   and   perform multiple   tasks   at   a   time   with   accurate   results. They   can   even   handle   tedious   repetitive   jobs  easily   with   the   help   of   AI   algorithms. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nDigital   Assistance Almost   all   the   big   organizations   these   days   use  digital   assistants   to   interact   with   their   customers  which   significantly   minimizes   the   need   for   human resources. You   can   chat   with   a   chatbot   and   ask   them   exactly  what   you   need. Some   chatbots   have   become   so   intelligent   these  days   that   you   wouldn’t   be   able   to   determine  whether   you   are   chatting   with   a   chatbot   or   a  human   being. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNew   Inventions AI   has   helped   in   coming   up   with   new  \t inventions   in   almost   every   domain   to   solve  \t complex   problems. A   recent   invention   has   helped   doctors   to  \t predict   early   stages   of   breast   cancer   in  \t women   using   advanced   AI- based \ttechnologies. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nUnbiased   Decisions Human   beings   are   driven   by   emotions,  \t whether   we   like   it   or   not. AI   on   the   other   hand,   is   devoid   of   emotions  \t and   highly   practical   and   rational   in   its  \t approach. A   huge   advantage   of   Artificial   Intelligence   is  \t that   it   doesn't   have   any   biased   views,   which \tensures   more   accurate   decision-making. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nHigh   Costs The   ability   to   create   a   machine   that   can  \t simulate   human   intelligence   is   no   small   feat. It   requires   plenty   of   time   and   resources   and  \t can   cost   a   huge   deal   of   money. AI   also   needs   to   operate   on   the   latest  \t hardware   and   software   to   stay   updated   and  \t meet   the   latest   requirements,   thus   making   it  \t quite   costly. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNo   creativity A   big   disadvantage   of   AI   is   that   it   cannot   learn   to   think  outside   the   box. AI   is   capable   of   learning   over   time   with   pre- fed   data   and  past   experiences,   but   cannot   be   creative   in   its   approach. A   classic   example   is   the   bot   Quill   who   can   write   Forbes  earning   reports.   These   reports   only   contain   data   and  facts   already   provided   to   the   bot. Although   it   is   impressive   that   a   bot   can   write   an   article  on   its   own,   it   lacks   the   human   touch   present   in   other  Forbes   articles. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nIncrease   in   Unemployment Perhaps   one   of   the   biggest   disadvantages   of  \t artificial   intelligence   is   that   AI   is   slowly   replacing   a  \t number   of   repetitive   tasks   with   bots. The   reduction   in   the   need   for   human   interference  \t has   resulted   in   the   death   of   many   job   opportunities. A   simple   example   is   the   chatbot   which   is   a   big  \t advantage   to   organizations,   but   a   nightmare   for  \t employees. A   study   by   McKinsey   predicts   that   AI   will   replace   at  \t least   30   percent   of   human   labour   by   2030. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nMake   Humans   Lazy AI   applications   automate   the   majority   of  \t tedious   and   repetitive   tasks. Since   we   do   not   have   to   memorize   things   or  \t solve   puzzles   to   get   the   job   done,   we   tend   to  \t use   our   brains   less   and   less. This   addiction   to   AI   can  cause   problems   to  \t future   generations.",

They   can   even   handle   tedious   repetitive   jobs  easily   with   the   help   of   AI   algorithms. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nDigital   Assistance Almost   all   the   big   organizations   these   days   use  digital   assistants   to   interact   with   their   customers  which   significantly   minimizes   the   need   for   human resources. You   can   chat   with   a   chatbot   and   ask   them   exactly  what   you   need. Some   chatbots   have   become   so   intelligent   these  days   that   you   wouldn’t   be   able   to   determine  whether   you   are   chatting   with   a   chatbot   or   a  human   being. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNew   Inventions AI   has   helped   in   coming   up   with   new  \t inventions   in   almost   every   domain   to   solve  \t complex   problems. A   recent   invention   has   helped   doctors   to  \t predict   early   stages   of   breast   cancer   in  \t women   using   advanced   AI- based \ttechnologies. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nUnbiased   Decisions Human   beings   are   driven   by   emotions,  \t whether   we   like   it   or   not. AI   on   the   other   hand,   is   devoid   of   emotions  \t and   highly   practical   and   rational   in   its  \t approach. A   huge   advantage   of   Artificial   Intelligence   is  \t that   it   doesn't   have   any   biased   views,   which \tensures   more   accurate   decision-making.",

The   decisions   taken   by   AI   in   every   step   is  \t decided   by   information   previously   gathered  \t and   a   certain   set   of   algorithms. When   programmed   properly,   these   errors   can  \t be   reduced   to  null. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nZero   Risks Another   big   advantage   of   AI   is   that   humans   can  overcome   many   risks   by   letting   AI   robots   do  them   for   us. Whether   it  be   defusing   a   bomb,   going   to   space,  exploring   the   deepest parts   of   oceans,  machines  with   metal   bodies   are   resistant  in  nature   and   can   survive   unfriendly   atmospheres. Moreover,   they   can   provide   accurate   work   with  greater   responsibility   and   not   wear   out   easily. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \n24x7   Availability There   are   many   studies   that   show   humans   are  productive   only   about   3   to   4   hours   in   a   day. Humans   also   need   breaks   and   time   offs   to  balance   their   work   life   and   personal   life.   But   AI  can   work   endlessly   without   breaks. They   think   much   faster   than   humans   and   perform multiple   tasks   at   a   time   with   accurate   results. They   can   even   handle   tedious   repetitive   jobs  easily   with   the   help   of   AI   algorithms. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nDigital   Assistance Almost   all   the   big   organizations   these   days   use  digital   assistants   to   interact   with   their   customers  which   significantly   minimizes   the   need   for   human resources. You   can   chat   with   a   chatbot   and   ask   them   exactly  what   you   need. Some   chatbots   have   become   so   intelligent   these  days   that   you   wouldn’t   be   able   to   determine  whether   you   are   chatting   with   a   chatbot   or   a  human   being. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNew   Inventions AI   has   helped   in   coming   up   with   new  \t inventions   in   almost   every   domain   to   solve  \t complex   problems. A   recent   invention   has   helped   doctors   to  \t predict   early   stages   of   breast   cancer   in  \t women   using   advanced   AI- based \ttechnologies. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nUnbiased   Decisions Human   beings   are   driven   by   emotions,  \t whether   we   like   it   or   not. AI   on   the   other   hand,   is   devoid   of   emotions  \t and   highly   practical   and   rational   in   its  \t approach. A   huge   advantage   of   Artificial   Intelligence   is  \t that   it   doesn't   have   any   biased   views,   which \tensures   more   accurate   decision-making. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nHigh   Costs The   ability   to   create   a   machine   that   can  \t simulate   human   intelligence   is   no   small   feat. It   requires   plenty   of   time   and   resources   and  \t can   cost   a   huge   deal   of   money. AI   also   needs   to   operate   on   the   latest  \t hardware   and   software   to   stay   updated   and  \t meet   the   latest   requirements,   thus   making   it  \t quite   costly. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNo   creativity A   big   disadvantage   of   AI   is   that   it   cannot   learn   to   think  outside   the   box. AI   is   capable   of   learning   over   time   with   pre- fed   data   and  past   experiences,   but   cannot   be   creative   in   its   approach. A   classic   example   is   the   bot   Quill   who   can   write   Forbes  earning   reports.   These   reports   only   contain   data   and  facts   already   provided   to   the   bot. Although   it   is   impressive   that   a   bot   can   write   an   article  on   its   own,   it   lacks   the   human   touch   present   in   other  Forbes   articles. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nIncrease   in   Unemployment Perhaps   one   of   the   biggest   disadvantages   of  \t artificial   intelligence   is   that   AI   is   slowly   replacing   a  \t number   of   repetitive   tasks   with   bots. The   reduction   in   the   need   for   human   interference  \t has   resulted   in   the   death   of   many   job   opportunities. A   simple   example   is   the   chatbot   which   is   a   big  \t advantage   to   organizations,   but   a   nightmare   for  \t employees. A   study   by   McKinsey   predicts   that   AI   will   replace   at  \t least   30   percent   of   human   labour   by   2030. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nMake   Humans   Lazy AI   applications   automate   the   majority   of  \t tedious   and   repetitive   tasks. Since   we   do   not   have   to   memorize   things   or  \t solve   puzzles   to   get   the   job   done,   we   tend   to  \t use   our   brains   less   and   less. This   addiction   to   AI   can  cause   problems   to  \t future   generations. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNo   Ethics Ethics   and   morality   are   important   human  \t features   that   can   be   difficult   to   incorporate  \t into   an   AI. The   rapid   progress   of   AI  has   raised   a   number  \t of   concerns   that   one   day,   AI   will   grow  \t uncontrollably,   and   eventually   wipe   out  \t humanity. This   moment   is   referred   to   as   the   AI  \t singularity.",

    "Advantages   and   Disadvantages   of   AI \nTushar   B.   Kute, http://tusharkute.com \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nReduction   in   Human   Error One   of   the   biggest   advantages   of   Artificial  \t Intelligence   is   that   it   can   significantly   reduce  \t errors   and   increase   accuracy   and   precision. The   decisions   taken   by   AI   in   every   step   is  \t decided   by   information   previously   gathered  \t and   a   certain   set   of   algorithms. When   programmed   properly,   these   errors   can  \t be   reduced   to  null. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nZero   Risks Another   big   advantage   of   AI   is   that   humans   can  overcome   many   risks   by   letting   AI   robots   do  them   for   us. Whether   it  be   defusing   a   bomb,   going   to   space,  exploring   the   deepest parts   of   oceans,  machines  with   metal   bodies   are   resistant  in  nature   and   can   survive   unfriendly   atmospheres. Moreover,   they   can   provide   accurate   work   with  greater   responsibility   and   not   wear   out   easily. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \n24x7   Availability There   are   many   studies   that   show   humans   are  productive   only   about   3   to   4   hours   in   a   day. Humans   also   need   breaks   and   time   offs   to  balance   their   work   life   and   personal   life.   But   AI  can   work   endlessly   without   breaks. They   think   much   faster   than   humans   and   perform multiple   tasks   at   a   time   with   accurate   results. They   can   even   handle   tedious   repetitive   jobs  easily   with   the   help   of   AI   algorithms. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nDigital   Assistance Almost   all   the   big   organizations   these   days   use  digital   assistants   to   interact   with   their   customers  which   significantly   minimizes   the   need   for   human resources. You   can   chat   with   a   chatbot   and   ask   them   exactly  what   you   need. Some   chatbots   have   become   so   intelligent   these  days   that   you   wouldn’t   be   able   to   determine  whether   you   are   chatting   with   a   chatbot   or   a  human   being. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNew   Inventions AI   has   helped   in   coming   up   with   new  \t inventions   in   almost   every   domain   to   solve  \t complex   problems. A   recent   invention   has   helped   doctors   to  \t predict   early   stages   of   breast   cancer   in  \t women   using   advanced   AI- based \ttechnologies. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nUnbiased   Decisions Human   beings   are   driven   by   emotions,  \t whether   we   like   it   or   not. AI   on   the   other   hand,   is   devoid   of   emotions  \t and   highly   practical   and   rational   in   its  \t approach. A   huge   advantage   of   Artificial   Intelligence   is  \t that   it   doesn't   have   any   biased   views,   which \tensures   more   accurate   decision-making. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nHigh   Costs The   ability   to   create   a   machine   that   can  \t simulate   human   intelligence   is   no   small   feat. It   requires   plenty   of   time   and   resources   and  \t can   cost   a   huge   deal   of   money. AI   also   needs   to   operate   on   the   latest  \t hardware   and   software   to   stay   updated   and  \t meet   the   latest   requirements,   thus   making   it  \t quite   costly. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNo   creativity A   big   disadvantage   of   AI   is   that   it   cannot   learn   to   think  outside   the   box. AI   is   capable   of   learning   over   time   with   pre- fed   data   and  past   experiences,   but   cannot   be   creative   in   its   approach. A   classic   example   is   the   bot   Quill   who   can   write   Forbes  earning   reports.   These   reports   only   contain   data   and  facts   already   provided   to   the   bot. Although   it   is   impressive   that   a   bot   can   write   an   article  on   its   own,   it   lacks   the   human   touch   present   in   other  Forbes   articles.",

Contact your Technology Support Professional for assistance. \nProtect your Operating System \nMicrosoft regularly issues patches or updates to solve security problems in their software. If these are not applied, it leaves your computer vulnerable to hackers. The Windows Update feature built into Windows can be set up to automatically download and install updates.  Avoid logging in as administrator Apple provides regular updates to its operating system and software applications.  Apply Apple updates using the App Store application. \nUse Strong Passwords \nMake passwords easy to remember but hard to guess \nUSG standards: Be at least ten characters in length  Must  contain characters from at least two of the following four types of characters:  English  upper case (A-Z) English lower case (a-z) Numbers (0-9) Non-alphanumeric special characters ($, !, %, ^, …) Must not contain the user’s name or part of the user’s name  Must  not contain easily accessible or guessable personal information about the user or user’s family, such as birthdays, children’s names, addresses, etc. \nAvoid Social Engineering  and Malicious Software \nDo not open email attachments unless you are expecting the email with the attachment and you trust the sender.  Do not click on links in emails unless you are absolutely sure of their validity . Only visit and/or download software from web pages you trust. \n\nAvoid  Hacker  Tricks \nBe sure to have a good firewall or pop-up blocker installed.  Pop-up blockers do not always block ALL pop-ups so always close a pop-up window using the ‘X’ in the upper corner.

Kute, http://tusharkute.com \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nReduction   in   Human   Error One   of   the   biggest   advantages   of   Artificial  \t Intelligence   is   that   it   can   significantly   reduce  \t errors   and   increase   accuracy   and   precision. The   decisions   taken   by   AI   in   every   step   is  \t decided   by   information   previously   gathered  \t and   a   certain   set   of   algorithms. When   programmed   properly,   these   errors   can  \t be   reduced   to  null. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nZero   Risks Another   big   advantage   of   AI   is   that   humans   can  overcome   many   risks   by   letting   AI   robots   do  them   for   us. Whether   it  be   defusing   a   bomb,   going   to   space,  exploring   the   deepest parts   of   oceans,  machines  with   metal   bodies   are   resistant  in  nature   and   can   survive   unfriendly   atmospheres. Moreover,   they   can   provide   accurate   work   with  greater   responsibility   and   not   wear   out   easily. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \n24x7   Availability There   are   many   studies   that   show   humans   are  productive   only   about   3   to   4   hours   in   a   day.

A   recent   invention   has   helped   doctors   to  \t predict   early   stages   of   breast   cancer   in  \t women   using   advanced   AI- based \ttechnologies. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nUnbiased   Decisions Human   beings   are   driven   by   emotions,  \t whether   we   like   it   or   not. AI   on   the   other   hand,   is   devoid   of   emotions  \t and   highly   practical   and   rational   in   its  \t approach. A   huge   advantage   of   Artificial   Intelligence   is  \t that   it   doesn't   have   any   biased   views,   which \tensures   more   accurate   decision-making. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nHigh   Costs The   ability   to   create   a   machine   that   can  \t simulate   human   intelligence   is   no   small   feat. It   requires   plenty   of   time   and   resources   and  \t can   cost   a   huge   deal   of   money. AI   also   needs   to   operate   on   the   latest  \t hardware   and   software   to   stay   updated   and  \t meet   the   latest   requirements,   thus   making   it  \t quite   costly. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNo   creativity A   big   disadvantage   of   AI   is   that   it   cannot   learn   to   think  outside   the   box. AI   is   capable   of   learning   over   time   with   pre- fed   data   and  past   experiences,   but   cannot   be   creative   in   its   approach. A   classic   example   is   the   bot   Quill   who   can   write   Forbes  earning   reports.   These   reports   only   contain   data   and  facts   already   provided   to   the   bot. Although   it   is   impressive   that   a   bot   can   write   an   article  on   its   own,   it   lacks   the   human   touch   present   in   other  Forbes   articles. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nIncrease   in   Unemployment Perhaps   one   of   the   biggest   disadvantages   of  \t artificial   intelligence   is   that   AI   is   slowly   replacing   a  \t number   of   repetitive   tasks   with   bots. The   reduction   in   the   need   for   human   interference  \t has   resulted   in   the   death   of   many   job   opportunities. A   simple   example   is   the   chatbot   which   is   a   big  \t advantage   to   organizations,   but   a   nightmare   for  \t employees. A   study   by   McKinsey   predicts   that   AI   will   replace   at  \t least   30   percent   of   human   labour   by   2030.",

The   decisions   taken   by   AI   in   every   step   is  \t decided   by   information   previously   gathered  \t and   a   certain   set   of   algorithms. When   programmed   properly,   these   errors   can  \t be   reduced   to  null. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nZero   Risks Another   big   advantage   of   AI   is   that   humans   can  overcome   many   risks   by   letting   AI   robots   do  them   for   us. Whether   it  be   defusing   a   bomb,   going   to   space,  exploring   the   deepest parts   of   oceans,  machines  with   metal   bodies   are   resistant  in  nature   and   can   survive   unfriendly   atmospheres.

They   can   even   handle   tedious   repetitive   jobs  easily   with   the   help   of   AI   algorithms. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nDigital   Assistance Almost   all   the   big   organizations   these   days   use  digital   assistants   to   interact   with   their   customers  which   significantly   minimizes   the   need   for   human resources. You   can   chat   with   a   chatbot   and   ask   them   exactly  what   you   need. Some   chatbots   have   become   so   intelligent   these  days   that   you   wouldn’t   be   able   to   determine  whether   you   are   chatting   with   a   chatbot   or   a  human   being. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNew   Inventions AI   has   helped   in   coming   up   with   new  \t inventions   in   almost   every   domain   to   solve  \t complex   problems. A   recent   invention   has   helped   doctors   to  \t predict   early   stages   of   breast   cancer   in  \t women   using   advanced   AI- based \ttechnologies. \nAdvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nUnbiased   Decisions Human   beings   are   driven   by   emotions,  \t whether   we   like   it   or   not. AI   on   the   other   hand,   is   devoid   of   emotions  \t and   highly   practical   and   rational   in   its  \t approach. A   huge   advantage   of   Artificial   Intelligence   is  \t that   it   doesn't   have   any   biased   views,   which \tensures   more   accurate   decision-making. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nHigh   Costs The   ability   to   create   a   machine   that   can  \t simulate   human   intelligence   is   no   small   feat. It   requires   plenty   of   time   and   resources   and  \t can   cost   a   huge   deal   of   money. AI   also   needs   to   operate   on   the   latest  \t hardware   and   software   to   stay   updated   and  \t meet   the   latest   requirements,   thus   making   it  \t quite   costly. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNo   creativity A   big   disadvantage   of   AI   is   that   it   cannot   learn   to   think  outside   the   box. AI   is   capable   of   learning   over   time   with   pre- fed   data   and  past   experiences,   but   cannot   be   creative   in   its   approach. A   classic   example   is   the   bot   Quill   who   can   write   Forbes  earning   reports.   These   reports   only   contain   data   and  facts   already   provided   to   the   bot. Although   it   is   impressive   that   a   bot   can   write   an   article  on   its   own,   it   lacks   the   human   touch   present   in   other  Forbes   articles. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nIncrease   in   Unemployment Perhaps   one   of   the   biggest   disadvantages   of  \t artificial   intelligence   is   that   AI   is   slowly   replacing   a  \t number   of   repetitive   tasks   with   bots. The   reduction   in   the   need   for   human   interference  \t has   resulted   in   the   death   of   many   job   opportunities. A   simple   example   is   the   chatbot   which   is   a   big  \t advantage   to   organizations,   but   a   nightmare   for  \t employees. A   study   by   McKinsey   predicts   that   AI   will   replace   at  \t least   30   percent   of   human   labour   by   2030. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nMake   Humans   Lazy AI   applications   automate   the   majority   of  \t tedious   and   repetitive   tasks. Since   we   do   not   have   to   memorize   things   or  \t solve   puzzles   to   get   the   job   done,   we   tend   to  \t use   our   brains   less   and   less. This   addiction   to   AI   can  cause   problems   to  \t future   generations. \nDisadvantages   of   Artificial   Intelligence \nNo   Ethics Ethics   and   morality   are   important   human  \t features   that   can   be   difficult   to   incorporate  \t into   an   AI. The   rapid   progress   of   AI  has   raised   a   number  \t of   concerns   that   one   day,   AI   will   grow  \t uncontrollably,   and   eventually   wipe   out  \t humanity. This   moment   is   referred   to   as   the   AI  \t singularity. \nSummary \n• \nArtificial   intelligence   has   massive   potential   for  creating   a   better   world   to   live   in. The   most   important   role   for   humans   will   be   to  ensure   that   the   rise   of   the   AI   doesn’t   get   out   of  hand. Although   there   are   both   debatable   pros   and   cons  of   artificial   intelligence   ,   its   impact   on   the   global  industry   is   undeniable. It   continues   to   grow   every   single   day   driving  sustainability   for   businesses. \n• \n• \n• \n\ncontact@mitu.co.in   tushar@tusharkute.com \nThank   you \n\nThis   presentation   is   created   using   LibreOffice   Impress   7.0.1.2,   can  be   used   freely   as   per   GNU   General   Public   License \n\nWeb   Resources  https://mitu.co.in  http://tusharkute.com \n/mITuSkillologies \n@mitu_group \n/company/mitu-  skillologies \nMITUSkillologies"
